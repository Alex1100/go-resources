## Program Structure

### Variables

- `var`
  - Zero Values
- Short Variable Declarations
  - Type Inference

[[↑] Back to top](#golang-notes)

### Type Declarations

> type name underlying-type

[[↑] Back to top](#golang-notes)

### Scope

The scope of a declaration is a region of the program text; it is a compile-time property.

Lexical blocks

Universe block

## Basic Data Types

- Integers
- Floating-Point Numbers
- Complex Numbers
- Booleans
- Strings
- Constants

## Composite Types

### Arrays

```go
[n]T
```

An array is a ﬁxed-length sequence of zero or more elements of a particular type. Because of their ﬁxed length, arrays are rarely used directly in Go. Slices, which can grow and shrink, are much more versatile.

### Slices

```go
[]T
```

Slices represent variable-length sequences whose elements all have the same type.

**Append**

```go
var x []int
x = append(x, 1)
```
